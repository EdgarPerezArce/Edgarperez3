        <sub>Inroduction</sub>

        <p>I was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Loved to play outside an explore the world around me. I aspired at a young age to become a scientist. As I walked through life, I had noticed that my interest has changed. Maybe it was joining the military. Or having my first child. Maybe marriage who knows. My life took many twists and turns.  Now I have a background in information technologies. It was great way to meld everything that I have learned over the years.</p>
